date: 2020-01-11 11:25:08
tags:
	- vim

---



generate an index (or "tag") file for a variety of language objects

This tag file allows these items to be quickly and easily located by a text editor or other utility

 Tag  index  files  are  supported  by numerous editors, 

"ctags *", or "ctags -R"

will  create  a  tag file in the current directory for all recognized source files



ctrl+] 和ctrl+t，都是ctags支持的快捷键。

其实没有什么要注意的。在vimrc里加上tags的路径就好了。
